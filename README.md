# QA Automation Portfolio

A growing collection of hands-on test automation projects to help me transition from manual QA to automation testing.

## Description

This project is part of my personal learning journey to become a skilled QA Automation Engineer. It includes small Python-based scripts, test cases, and experiments involving unit testing, API testing, and more.

Each file or folder demonstrates a specific concept, and over time this will evolve into a professional-grade automation portfolio.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.12
- Git & GitHub
- Pylint (code linter)
- VS Code

Upcoming:
- pytest (unit testing)
- requests (for API testing)
- Selenium (for UI automation)
- Locust (for load testing)

## How to Run

```bash
python basics_practice.py
