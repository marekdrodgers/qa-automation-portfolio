# QA Automation Portfolio

## Overview
This repository is my QA Automation portfolio where I practice and demonstrate skills including:

- Manual and automated testing fundamentals
- Python scripting and test automation with pytest
- API testing (basic GET requests and mocking)
- Load testing basics with Locust and analysis of results
- Writing clean, documented, and maintainable test code following PEP 8 standards
- Managing code with Git, including commits and pushing to GitHub

## Progress so far
- Set up Python environment with virtualenv and pylint
- Created reusable test functions and modular code in `/src` and `/tests`
- Implemented API tests with live endpoints and mocked responses
- Performed load testing and documented results with markdown and charts
- Applied coding standards including module and function docstrings
- Learned basic git workflow: staging, committing, pushing, and branching

## Next steps
- Add authenticated API testing
- Explore UI test automation with Selenium or Playwright
- Deepen load testing and performance analysis
- Build a test framework and continuous integration pipeline

Feel free to explore the code and tests in the `/src` and `/tests` directories.
